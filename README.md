# JHubModule4C
Guidance and dataset for the JHub Coding Module, Challenge 4C.

This notebook is a template for module 4C from the JHub Coding Scheme. 

When you make a submission, your notebook will be tested in Google Colab, so it is essential that your code has been tested and works without any issues on the Google Colab platform.

This notebook has been produced to improve the consistency of submissions, and to act as a basic starting point for the challenge. Despite this, the challenge still aims to give students a good amount of flexibility in applying a range of techniques and chosen processes to solve the challenge. This challenge is designed to be a considerable step-up compared to Challenge 4B, and as such should test the ability of students more thoroughly for applying various principles of data science and machine learning.

You need to populate the required functions to solve this problem. All dependencies should be documented in the next cell.
